    We integrated a PPG (Photoplethysmography) sensor to capture blood volume changes and a Bluetooth module for wireless data transmission, achieving a stable 16Hz data transfer frequency. The backend, built with Flask, processes this data using a trained machine learning model to predict glucose levels.
    The user interface was developed across multiple platforms: a React.js web app for easy access, a React Native mobile app for on-the-go monitoring, and an Electron.js desktop application for comprehensive data analysis. This full-stack approach ensured a seamless user experience across devices. The project was recognized with funding from the Government of Gujarat, highlighting its innovation and potential impact.`,
